def solution(area):
  '''solution(area) takes as its input a single unit of measure representing the total area of solar panels you have 
  (between 1 and 1000000 inclusive) and returns a list of the areas of the largest squares you could make out of those panels, 
  starting with the largest squares first. So, solution(12) would return [9, 1, 1, 1].'''
